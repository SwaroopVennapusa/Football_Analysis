# Football_Analysis

## Introduction

This project utilizes YOLO for real-time detection and tracking of players, referees, and football in the video, and also enhanced the model accuracy through training. It employs K-means clustering for team assignment by t-shirt colors and optical flow to analyze camera movement. Perspective transformation technique is used to measure player movement in meters, facilitating the calculation of speed and distance covered in a match.
